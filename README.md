# Special-Relativity-Animation
Scripts for teachers/students to use for modeling Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction as well as Penrose-Terrell Rotation (and optical effects in 1,2 dimensions as well). 

Scripts:

Make_Shape: Produces N points of a d dimensional cubeoid that can be extracted or transformed point by point. 
SR_Transforms: Transforms points made by Make_Shape for either Lorentz contraction or Penrose-Terrell Rotation
Animate_Shape: Builds 3D Vispy animation of transformed points and plays a loop of beta (velocity/c) = [0, 1) then back to beta = 0.

These animations can be saved as .mp4 (20s long), or snapshots at various beta can be saved at .png
